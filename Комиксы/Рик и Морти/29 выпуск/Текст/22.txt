R: All right pal, let's get you on home.
M: What the f**k, Rick?!
R: What the fuck what? Let's go home, you've done the universe a great blah blah blah

M: You killed me.
R: Oh please, you know Mortys die all the time. I saved this, however inconsequential, Morty.
R: Come on.

M: I can't give up! Especially now that there's one less of me out there.
R: One less than infinite, Morty? Really?
R: Look there's infinite dimensions of potential Hitlers out there. And, if your little noodle can handle it, infinite fascism-fighting Morty's out there trying to stop them.
M: So...

R: So you can go home and hop your pretty pink ass on the couch and rest easy knowing that someone else id holding the wave of fascism at bay. You don't have to do shit.
M: Really?
R: Really. It's someone else's problem.

M: Jeez, Rick, i never thought of it that way.
R: Of course you didn't.
